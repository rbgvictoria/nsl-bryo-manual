# New author

You can create a new author by clicking on **New** in the top menu and then on **Authors**

- **Name**: this is the name as you would like it to appear in the citation of a Reference.

- **Abbreviation**: This is the standardised abbreviation that will appear in the authorship of the name. APNI and AusMoss use the author abbreviation standards set by IPNI (e.g. N.Pederson, not N. Pederson)

::: tip Note
For groups of authors, just type in the entire string, for example 'Spence, J.R. & Ramsay, H.P.' in the **Name** field and 'J.R.Spence & H.P.Ramsay' in the **Abbreviation** field.

For author strings with three or more authors, I prefer to separate the authors with semicolons, rather than commas, as it makes for easier parsing, even if it might not look as nice in the front end. For example, 'Tan, B.C.; Ramsay, H.P. & Schofield, W.B.'.
